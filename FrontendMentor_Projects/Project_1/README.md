## My process

I first made the desktop version and afterwards I've added the mobile one. In the end I spent time polishing them both.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

```css
.my-cont {
    display: grid;
    position: relative;
    grid-template-columns: auto auto;
    grid-template-rows: auto auto;
    width: 38rem;
    margin-left: auto;
    margin-right: auto;
    margin-top: 200px
}
```

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.

I learned size value "rem" and also how to make my own container that includes grid.
### Continued development

I want to master usage of grid and flexbox - I still don't feel completely comfortable using them.

### Useful resources

- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp) - This helped me to navigate my way through CSS and to acquire some basic knowledge.
- [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) - This is an amazing page that pretty much has solution for every question I've had.
