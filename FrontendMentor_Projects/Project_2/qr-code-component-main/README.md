## Overview

This is my 2nd project on Frontend mentor. It is even easier than the first one, but it was still a fun one to build.

## My process

I first made the container, then I followed everything in style-guide. Once done with the basic stuff in both HTML and CSS i focused on the image and the text.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

Image resizing, positioning and scaling elements properly.

### Continued development

Upon getting some useful advice on the page, I followed the best practices and made this project. Despite it being easier than the last one, I feel more confident in my HTML & CSS skills.

### Useful resources
